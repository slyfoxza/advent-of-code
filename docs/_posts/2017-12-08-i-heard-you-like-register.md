# Perl
The default tab of examples shown on the [Perl 6 homepage][perl6home] shows off
its support for declaring grammars, so I decided to put that to the test with
this challenge.

[I think the result speaks for itself][perl6], especially when compared against
the monstrosities that were my [Rust Assembunny implementations from
2016][assembunny].

Now if the Perl 6 runtime packaged for Fedora 27 could run a bit faster, that'd
be greatâ€¦
