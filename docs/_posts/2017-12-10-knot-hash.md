# Python
I implemented the [first part][1] by making judicious use of list slicing
within a generator-based loop providing the input lengths.

For the [second part][2], I extracted the loop interior to the `do` method,
allowing for re-use in both parts. I also [fixed an error in the slicing
logic][3] which happened not to affect the answer of the first part.

The conversion from sparse to dense hash was done using a combination of the
`reduce` method and a generator yielding blocks of 16 elements from the sparse
hash.
