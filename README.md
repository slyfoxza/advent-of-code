Advent of Code
==============

[Advent of Code](http://adventofcode.com/) is a series of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill levels.
This is my repository.
There are many like it, but this one is mine.

This branch implements solutions to the puzzles using [literate programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Literate_programming), by way of the [Literate tool](http://literate.zbyedidia.webfactional.com/).
The resulting HTML output will be published to [GitHub Pages](https://slyfoxza.github.io/advent-of-code/).
